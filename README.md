# podsample-myapp

This app exemplifies the usage of a custom Cocoa Touch Framework. 

The framework contains different components who can be reused by this app. At the moment this app is using only the AvatarView component and displaying a local image.

Notes...
1) The pod is currently pointing to a the framework's git repository but it could also point to a local url to be able to modify it on the go while developing the app
2) Take a look at the repository at https://github.com/luz-ams/podsample-mycocoatouchframework to see how the podspec is defined.
